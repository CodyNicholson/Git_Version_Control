# Merging

From your branch, call it myBranch, you can merge to master by using: git merge master

This will merge master into myBranch without removing either

***

Fast-forward merging - happens when the branch you are merging into is an ancestor of the branch you are merging from

***

### Merging Conflicts

The top section is the users code, the middle is the original code that both branches modified, and the bottom is the code that was from the other branch

Choose what code to discard and what to keep manually, delete the special characters added by Git, commit the changes to complete the merge
