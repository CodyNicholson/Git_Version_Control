# Pull Requests

A pull request pushes your changes up to Github for people to see and review

Always check if any changes have been made to the master branch before you submit a pull request because when your peers review your code, they are going to want to see the most recent code with your changes

If there have been changes, switch to your branch and merge your branch with master (git merge master) so you still have your branch but you also have the most updated master branch too

Once you have the most recent code combined with your new code you can create a pull request so that others can review your code before merging it to master for you

You usually do not want to merge your own code to master because then its like you are approving your own code, which can lead to problems on a team
