Workflow to get feedback on project before you update to master branch.

1. Have a copy of the code on github locally
2. Create a new branch "change" locally, and add your change.
3. Push that change to your fork on GitHub
4. Make a pull request (or merge request) on GitHub
5. If there are multiple pull requests you can solve them one at a time
