# Workflow Notes

### Creating a Repository and pushing data to github from it:

```
git init   (creates git metadata)
git remote add <remote name> <GitHub repository URL to assign to remote> (creates remote to github repository)
git status   (View all files in this directory that are not committed)
git add .   (Add all files and folders in this directory, you can also do this individually)
git commit -m 'Enter Commit Message Here'   (-m means include commit description)
git push -u <remote name> <branch name>   (This puts your code into the github repository at the remotes URL)
```
