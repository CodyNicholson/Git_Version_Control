# Two Types of Version Control Systems

### Centralized

A Centralized VCS is one where all members of the dev team are committing to the same version of the project saved on the Internet

### Decentralized

A Decentralized VCS is one where each dev has a local copy of the project and a local commit history that they push to the internet with the other dev's code every so often
